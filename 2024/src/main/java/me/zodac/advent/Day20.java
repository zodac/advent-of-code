    /**
     * Given a {@link Character} {@link Grid} with a known start {@link Point} and end {@link Point}, find the shortest path between them avoiding any
     * {@value #OBSTACLE_SYMBOL}s. We can assume there is only <b>one</b> valid path between these two {@link Point}s.
     *
     * <p>
     * For {@code maximumDistanceBetweenPoints}, we are permitted to 'cheat' and to ignore the {@value #OBSTACLE_SYMBOL}s and simply pass through them
     * and traverse towards {@value #END_SYMBOL}. A cheat is considered as any pair of two {@link Point}, regardless of what path they take, as long
     * as the first and last {@link Point}s of the cheat are the same. We need to find all cheats that can save at least {@code minimumSavings} steps
     * from the shortest path found earlier.
     *
     * <p>
     * We can determine this by doing the following. For each {@link Point} on the known shortest path:
     * <ol>
     *     <li>Find all {@link Point}s remaining on the path with a Manhattan distance less that {@code maximumDistanceBetweenPoints}</li>
     *     <li>
     *         For that pair of first and second {@link Point}s, calculate the potential savings by performing a cheat.
     *         The saving is calculated as the distance between the two {@link Point}s (distance using the cheat), <b>minus</b> the distance between
     *         the {@link Point}s along the shortest path (can be retrieved by the index of the {@link Point}s within an ordered {@link List} of the
     *         shortest path).
     *     </li>
     *     <li>If the saving is greater than {@code minimumSavings}, it is a valid cheat</li>
     * </ol>
     *
     * @param characterGrid                the input {@link Character} {@link Grid}
     * @param maximumDistanceBetweenPoints the distance between {@link Point}s to consider for the cheat
     * @param minimumSavings               the minimum saving required for a cheat to be valid
     * @return the number of cheats that save at least {@code minimumSavings}
     * @see PathFinder#shortest(Grid, Point, Point, AdjacentDirection, BiPredicate)
